# Project Desription

This is a solution to the [FrontendMentor Todo App Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW) using Nextjs, Tailwindcss, recoil, and MongoDB.
Figma design is not available for this project, so the design dimensions, margins, and padding are not pixel perfect.
